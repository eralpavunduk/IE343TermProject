Q1

For question one, Ä±t has been asked for filling the 30 minutes of album. 
The question looked like an knapsack problem. To solve a knapsack problem we choosed bottom up algorithm
which can iterate all durations of songs and fit in the album. 
We optimized the durations and found their values. On the code we didn't delete codes by Berk because of the important content.
This codes can be written in one class so we didn't create another classes.
Also, who run the will see that console shows the data. We let them for checking easier than opening excel files. 



Our solution gives us the songs which chosen by algorithm:

50 49 48 47 46 45 44 43 42 41 40 38 36 
497.23654

In the first row gives us the songs and the second is the value which we found.
There is a 34,76 point difference with Berk's solution.

Q2

For this question, there was only two songs was important for consultant. To changing songs has values. 
So, we determined these songs values first. 

Having most value of songs are 43 to 28 with 9.87. Therefore we choosed the first and second songs as 43 and 28. 
Second most value songs has 4 to 3 with 9.51. Because of having no other condition. We sorted other songs in an order like below.

43 28 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 4 3 

This has an exact solution because we picked best two songs.
